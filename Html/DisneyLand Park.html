                <br> This Disneyland Park is one of the biggest Disneylands in the world, and was designed and constructed under the instructions of Walt Disney himself!. Opened way back in 1955, the Disneyland Park is perhaps one of the best Disney theme parks in the world, if not the best. This park in particular was the first physical manifestation of Walt Disney's idea of a Disneyland, an idea that hit him after he visited various parks with his daughters. The park is absolutely massive, spread across 8 huge lands, with the first being - as usual - the Main Street, USA. Just like you'd expect, it's like revisiting every single Disney show you've ever seen. The park has huge castles and models, rides and shops, it's like a giant land of happiness! Even getting around is a fun task, with the scenic Disneyland Railroad and the Monorail, which will take you across setups which you will identify from the movies and the shows! Located within is the Disneyland Resort, one of the largest in the world, and among the busiest theme parks globally.
